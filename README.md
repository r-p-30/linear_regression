# Bike Rental Prediction using Linear Regression

## Overview
This project aims to predict bike rental demand using Linear Regression. The dataset consists of historical bike rental data, and the goal is to build a model that accurately forecasts demand based on various features such as time, weather, and seasonality.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** – Data analysis and modeling  
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data manipulation and analysis  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **Scikit-Learn** – Machine learning models and evaluation  

## Dataset

### Training Data
- `train.csv`

### Testing Data
- `test.csv`

## Features in the Dataset
- **Date & Time Features** (e.g., year, month, day, hour)  
- **Weather Conditions** (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed)  
- **Bike Rental Count** (Target variable for training)
